Social Epistemology of Mathematics Workshop
Date: February 5-6, 2025
Location: Brussels, Belgium
Cost: Free but registration for attendance is mandatory
Website: https://yhamami.github.io/social-epist-math-workshop/

== Description

Like other scientific fields, mathematics is a collective endeavor. Although the social dimension of mathematics has been mostly neglected in the philosophy of mathematics, it has become a central subject of investigation within the so-called philosophy of mathematical practice. The objective of this workshop is to bring together philosophers of mathematical practice to present and discuss recent advances in the social epistemology of mathematics. 

The workshop will take place on February 5 (starting at 3pm) to February 6 (ending at 3pm), 2025, at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. It is an in-person event.
